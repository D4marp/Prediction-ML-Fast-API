# FastAPI Application

This project is a FastAPI-based application that provides a robust backend for managing items, users, and sales predictions. It includes features such as authentication, CRUD operations, and machine learning-based sales predictions.

## Features

1. **User Management**:
   - Create new users.
   - Retrieve user details by username.
   - Secure user authentication with hashed passwords and JWT tokens.

2. **Item Management**:
   - Create, retrieve, update, and delete items.
   - Manage item availability status.

3. **Sales Prediction**:
   - Predict sales based on input features using a trained machine learning model.

4. **Authentication**:
   - Secure endpoints with OAuth2 and JWT-based authentication.
   - Token-based access control for users.

5. **Middlewares**:
   - Logging middleware for tracking requests and responses.
   - CORS middleware for cross-origin resource sharing.

6. **Database**:
   - SQLAlchemy-based database models and session management.
   - SQLite database for local development.

7. **Logging**:
   - Centralized logging for database changes and application events.

## Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST** `/token`: Obtain an access token by providing username and password.

### User Management
- **POST** `/users/`: Create a new user.
- **GET** `/users/{username}`: Retrieve user details by username.

### Item Management
- **POST** `/items/`: Create a new item.
- **GET** `/items/`: Retrieve all items.
- **GET** `/items/{item_id}`: Retrieve an item by ID.
- **PUT** `/items/{item_id}`: Update an item by ID.
- **PATCH** `/items/{item_id}`: Partially update an item by ID.
- **DELETE** `/items/{item_id}`: Delete an item by ID.

### Sales Prediction
- **POST** `/predict-sales/`: Predict sales based on input features.
